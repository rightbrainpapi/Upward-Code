			<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
			<p>
				<strong class="points">Be inclusive. </strong> We at Upward Code welcome
				and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but
				is not limited to members of any sexual orientation, gender identity and
				expression, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and
				economic class, educational level, color, immigration status, sex, age,
				size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical
				ability.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong class="points">Be respectful.</strong> We won't all agree all
				the time, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behavior. We
				will all experience frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow
				that frustration to become personal attacks. An environment where people
				feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive or creative one.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong class="points">Choose your words carefully.</strong> Always
				conduct yourself professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put
				down others. Harassment and exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
				<br>This includes, but is not limited to:
				<ul style="list-style:none;">
					<li>- Threats of violence.</li>
					<li>- Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
					<li>- Sharing sexually explicit or violent material via electronic devices or other means. </li>
					<li>- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms. </li>
					<li>- Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
					<li>- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong class="points">Do not harass others.</strong> In general, if
				someone asks you to stop something, then stop. When we disagree, try to
				understand why. Differences of opinion and disagreements are mostly
				unavoidable. What is important is that we resolve disagreements and
				differing views constructively.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong class="points">Our differences can be our strengths.</strong> We
				can find strength in diversity. Different people have different
				perspectives on issues, and that can be valuable for solving problems or
				generating new ideas. Being unable to understand why someone holds a
				viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that we all make
				mistakes, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus
				on resolving issues and learning from mistakes.
